**Step 1)** Fork or download this repo    
(if you're forking it, be sure to make sure *your* repo is on a branch called `gh-pages`, so that GitHub can automatically generate a webpage for it!)

**Step 2)** Translate the following files:

`index.html` -- The title & social sharing text (a few words)    
`words.html` -- All the words for the interactive itself (~3,300 words)    
(optional) `notes/index.html` -- The footnotes (~1,100 words)    
(optional) `peeps/index.html` -- The full credits (a few words)

**Step 3)** Remember to test your translation! You can test things locally using [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/).

**Step 4)** Email me with a link to your forked repo / the translated files, at `N {{at}} NCASE {{dot}} ME` There may be a few things here and there we need to fix! (also, if you run into any issues, please email me as well! I may take a while to respond since I'm away the next couple weeks)

**Step 5)** Wait for me to stop being busy and/or lazy and actually link your translated version from the main English version

**Step 6)** Party! ðŸŽ‰
